2. Import the form and module files:
   - Right-click on your project in Project Explorer
   - Select "Import File" and choose the form (.frm) and module (.bas) files
3. Adjust references if needed (usually no additional references required)

Customizing for Your Project

3. Customize form appearance and labels as needed

Code Structure
Main Form (UerForm1)

Security Notes
- This is a basic implementation - consider enhancing security for production use
- Passwords are stored in plain text for demo purposes - implement encryption for real applications
- Add additional security measures like account lockouts for failed attempts

Troubleshooting
Common Issues
1. Form not showing: Ensure all form components are properly imported
2. Login not working: Verify the demo credentials or your custom validation logic
3. Compile errors: Check for missing references or syntax errors

Debugging Tips
- Use `Debug.Print` statements to track authentication flow
- Check immediate window (Ctrl+G) for error messages
- Validate user input formatting
